# **Basic Use**

MARP operates by converting text code into a presentation. VS Code will be the primary tool that you will use to both edit and preview your slides. 

Once you have defined your initial MARP presentation settings on lines 2-6 you will be ready to begin creating your slides. The horizontal ruler will be used to create new pages simply input --- on a new line leaving 1 line between your last written text to start a new slide. 

There are 3 built in themes default, gaia and uncover; you may also create custom themes. The background color can be set using standard color codes #xyz. The background image may be any image that you choose it is recommended that this image is uploaded to the Git repository or folder that your Markdown Presentation is saved to.
